This code is a simple **web scraping** script written in Node.js using the *axios and cheerio libraries*. 

It fetches data from a specific URL and extracts project information from the HTML using *cheerio*.

Prerequisites:
- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)
- NPM (Node Package Manager)

Installation:
- Clone or download the repository.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Run npm install to install the required dependencies (axios and cheerio).

Usage:
- Open the code file in a text editor.
- Replace the url variable **with the URL of the website you want to scrape**.
- Run the script by executing node filename.js in your terminal.
- The script will make a GET request to the specified URL, fetch the HTML content, and then use cheerio to parse the HTML and extract project information. The extracted data is stored in an array called projects. The script will log the projects array to the console.

Customization:
If you want to scrape a different website, replace the *url* variable with the desired URL.
You can modify the CSS selector **('.news-list-item')** and the data fields **('h3' and 'a')** within the **$('.news-list-item', html).each()** function to match the structure of the target website and extract different data.
